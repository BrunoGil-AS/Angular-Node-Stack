## day-1-the-foundation

**Overview:** TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static types. It helps catch errors early through a type system and makes JavaScript development more efficient. Something important to note about TS is patch to improve some of the inconvenient of working with a weakly typed language like JS. Event though TS add many layers and features to make it feel more robust, like the use of interfaces, typed functions, and so on. But without losing the essence of JS, which is flexible and dynamic. This brings balance to a language commonly used to build large-scale applications.

## day-2-functions-objects-and-enums

**overview:**The treatment of functions in TS are like in other languages, having types for parameters and return types. And Just like in Python, Java lamba functions here called Arrow Functions, like in js are supported too, whit the same syntax.

On the other hand, Objects in TS can be defined as Interfaces or types, commonly used to shape and pack the data, making a marked difference compared with other languages, where objects are defined through classes.

Enums in TS are a way to define a set of named constants, making the code more readable and intent-revealing, compared to using plain numbers or strings. This is quite similar to other languages like Java or C#, where enums are also used to define a collection of related constants.
