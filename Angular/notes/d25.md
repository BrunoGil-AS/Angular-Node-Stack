# Day 25: Integrated Frontend Project (Capstone)

## Goal

Build a small but complete Angular frontend that integrates routing, HTTP APIs, forms, state, and deployment.

---

## Minimal Feature List

- Authentication (login/logout)
- CRUD tasks with remote API
- Routing and guarded routes
- Forms for create/edit
- Shared state store (signals or service)
- Responsive UI and basic styling
- Unit tests for services/components

---

## Checklist

- [ ] Project scaffolded with CLI and TypeScript
- [ ] Environment config (dev/prod)
- [ ] API base URL token
- [ ] Auth interceptor and guard
- [ ] Task service and store
- [ ] Forms implemented (reactive)
- [ ] Routing with lazy loaded features
- [ ] Unit tests (Jest/Karma + TestBed)
- [ ] E2E tests (optional)
- [ ] CI pipeline (build + test)
- [ ] README with run/build instructions

---

## Development Steps

1. Scaffold app and install deps: Angular, RxJS, Tailwind/Bootstrap (optional).
2. Create feature modules: `auth`, `tasks` (lazy-loadable).
3. Implement API service and interceptors.
4. Implement store with signals or simple service.
5. Add forms and validation for tasks.
6. Secure routes with guards.
7. Add tests for critical logic.
8. Setup `ng build --configuration production` and deploy to Netlify/Vercel/GH Pages.

---

## Deployment

- Build production bundle

```bash
ng build --configuration production
```

- Serve static files with any static host; for SPA ensure redirect to `index.html` for unknown routes.

---

## Evaluation Criteria

- App runs locally with `ng serve`.
- API integration works with proper error handling.
- Routing and guards behave as expected.
- Forms validate and persist data.
- Basic tests pass.

---

## Next Steps (Optional)

- Add pagination, search, and filtering.
- Add offline caching and service workers.
- Add analytics and monitoring.
- Extract shared UI components and publish a design system.
