# Day 25: Integrated Frontend Project (Capstone)

## Goal

Build a small but complete Angular frontend that integrates routing, HTTP APIs, forms, state, and deployment.

---

## Minimal Feature List

- CRUD tasks with remote API
- Routing and guarded routes
- Forms for create/edit
- Shared state store (signals or service)
- Responsive UI and basic styling
- Unit tests for services/components

---

## Checklist

- [ ] Project scaffolded with CLI and TypeScript
- [ ] Task service and store
- [ ] Forms implemented (reactive)
- [ ] Routing with lazy loaded features
- [ ] README with run/build instructions

---

## Evaluation Criteria

- App runs locally with `ng serve`.
- API integration works with proper error handling.
- Routing and guards behave as expected.
- Forms validate and persist data.
- Basic tests pass.

## Next Steps (Optional)

- Add pagination, search, and filtering.
- Add offline caching and service workers.
- Add analytics and monitoring.
- Extract shared UI components and publish a design system.
