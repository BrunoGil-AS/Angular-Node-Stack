This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 21.0.4.

**Exercise:**

- Create a list of objects in your component (e.g., products).
- Use @for to render a card for each product.
- Use @if to show a "Sold Out" badge if product.stock === 0.

## Observations

The use of control flow directives like `*ngFor` and `*ngIf` in Angular templates allows for dynamic rendering of content based on the data model. This enhances the user experience by providing relevant information, such as indicating when a product is sold out.
